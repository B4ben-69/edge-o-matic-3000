 * Schr√∂dinger's Thread Safety. It is and is not until it crashes and the core dump can be observed.
 *
 * @param filename Path to the resulting file, absolute, plz. This can be NULL, btw, in which case a
 * filename will be generated.
 * @return size_t Size of the data written to the file. If this is 0 you may have an issue.
